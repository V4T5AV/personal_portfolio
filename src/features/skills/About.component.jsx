        Welcome! I am Nagam Srivatsav Reddy, with strong skills in full-stack web development, a solid grip on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and practical experience in building real-world projects. I have worked on several impactful applications, including a Smart Carpooling App, a Workout Tracker, and a Fake Medicine Detection System using AI. I also have good backend experience with Flask, Node.js, and MySQL, and frontend expertise using React and Bootstrap.<br /><br />
        In DSA, Iâ€™ve been consistently solving problems to improve my competitive coding skills and strengthen my core fundamentals. I am also exploring AI/ML with hands-on mini projects like EMR summarization and healthcare-based LLM integration.
